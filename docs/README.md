# Muster documentation

Read in this order when onboarding:

1. **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** — goals, architecture, component map
2. **[ADAPTER-SPEC.md](ADAPTER-SPEC.md)** — `NormalizedEvent`, `Backend` interface
3. **[CLI-COMMANDS.md](CLI-COMMANDS.md)** — exact CLI flags (verified empirically)

Operational evidence:

- [File-drop live-host evidence](uat/m007-s02/file-drop-live-host-evidence.md) — scenario-local Extension Development Host verdicts and proof boundary.
- [Task-export live-host evidence](uat/m009-s03/task-export-live-host-evidence.md) — native Save As / cancel / overwrite / Unicode filename / write-failure ledger (PASS, FAIL, or ENVIRONMENT BLOCKED).

All docs are living — update when CLI versions or spikes change behavior.
